  abstract       = {The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network is a National Human Genome
      Research Institute-funded consortium engaged in the development of methods and
      best practices for using the electronic medical record as a tool for genomic
      research. Now in its sixth year and second funding cycle, and comprising nine
      research groups and a coordinating center, the network has played a major role in
      validating the concept that clinical data derived from electronic medical records
      can be used successfully for genomic research. Current work is advancing
      knowledge in multiple disciplines at the intersection of genomics and health-care
      informatics, particularly for electronic phenotyping, genome-wide association
      studies, genomic medicine implementation, and the ethical and regulatory issues
      associated with genomics research and returning results to study participants.
      Here, we describe the evolution, accomplishments, opportunities, and challenges
      of the network from its inception as a five-group consortium focused on
      genotype-phenotype associations for genomic discovery to its current form as a
      nine-group consortium pivoting toward the implementation of genomic medicine.},

@article{McMurry:PLSO2013,
  abstract       = {Results of medical research studies are often contradictory or cannot be
      reproduced. One reason is that there may not be enough patient subjects available
      for observation for a long enough time period. Another reason is that patient
      populations may vary considerably with respect to geographic and demographic
      boundaries thus limiting how broadly the results apply. Even when similar patient
      populations are pooled together from multiple locations, differences in medical
      treatment and record systems can limit which outcome measures can be commonly
      analyzed. In total, these differences in medical research settings can lead to
      differing conclusions or can even prevent some studies from starting. We thus
      sought to create a patient research system that could aggregate as many patient
      observations as possible from a large number of hospitals in a uniform way. We
      call this system the 'Shared Health Research Information Network', with the
      following properties: (1) reuse electronic health data from everyday clinical
      care for research purposes, (2) respect patient privacy and hospital autonomy,
      (3) aggregate patient populations across many hospitals to achieve statistically 
      significant sample sizes that can be validated independently of a single research
      setting, (4) harmonize the observation facts recorded at each institution such
      that queries can be made across many hospitals in parallel, (5) scale to regional
      and national collaborations. The purpose of this report is to provide open source
      software for multi-site clinical studies and to report on early uses of this
      application. At this time SHRINE implementations have been used for multi-site
      studies of autism co-morbidity, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, peripartum
      cardiomyopathy, colorectal cancer, diabetes, and others. The wide range of study 
      objectives and growing adoption suggest that SHRINE may be applicable beyond the 
      research uses and participating hospitals named in this report.},

  abstract       = {OBJECTIVES: To describe the IMI EHR4CR project which is designing and developing,
      and aims to demonstrate, a scalable, widely acceptable and efficient approach to 
      interoperability between EHR systems and clinical research systems. METHODS: The 
      IMI EHR4CR project is combining and extending several previously isolated
      state-of-the-art technical components through a new approach to develop a
      platform for reusing EHR data to support medical research. This will be achieved 
      through multiple but unified initiatives across different major disease areas
      (e.g. cardiovascular, cancer) and clinical research use cases (protocol
      feasibility, patient identification and recruitment, clinical trial execution and
      serious adverse event reporting), with various local and national stakeholders
      across several countries and therefore under various legal frameworks. RESULTS:
      An initial instance of the platform has been built, providing communication,
      security and terminology services to the eleven participating hospitals and ten
      pharmaceutical companies located in seven European countries. Proof-of-concept
      demonstrators have been built and evaluated for the protocol feasibility and
      patient recruitment scenarios. The specifications of the clinical trial execution
      and the adverse event reporting scenarios have been documented and reviewed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Through a combination of a consortium that brings collectively many 
      years of experience from previous relevant EU projects and of the global conduct 
      of clinical trials, of an approach to ethics that engages many important
      stakeholders across Europe to ensure acceptability, of a robust iterative design 
      methodology for the platform services that is anchored on requirements of an
      underlying Service Oriented Architecture that has been designed to be scalable
      and adaptable, EHR4CR could be well placed to deliver a sound, useful and well
      accepted pan-European solution for the reuse of hospital EHR data to support
      clinical research studies.},

  abstract       = {UNLABELLED: The Learning Health System (LHS) describes linking routine healthcare
      systems directly with both research translation and knowledge translation as an
      extension of the evidence-based medicine paradigm, taking advantage of the
      ubiquitous use of electronic health record (EHR) systems. TRANSFoRm is an EU FP7 
      project that seeks to develop an infrastructure for the LHS in European primary
      care. METHODS: The project is based on three clinical use cases, a
      genotype-phenotype study in diabetes, a randomised controlled trial with
      gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a diagnostic decision support system for
      chest pain, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath. RESULTS: Four models were
      developed (clinical research, clinical data, provenance, and diagnosis) that form
      the basis of the projects approach to interoperability. These models are
      maintained as ontologies with binding of terms to define precise data elements.
      CDISC ODM and SDM standards are extended using an archetype approach to enable a 
      two-level model of individual data elements, representing both research content
      and clinical content. Separate configurations of the TRANSFoRm tools serve each
      use case. CONCLUSIONS: The project has been successful in using ontologies and
      archetypes to develop a highly flexible solution to the problem of heterogeneity 
      of data sources presented by the LHS.},

@article{Klann:JAMIA2016,
  abstract       = {OBJECTIVE: Reinventing data extraction from electronic health records (EHRs) to
      meet new analytical needs is slow and expensive. However, each new data research 
      network that wishes to support its own analytics tends to develop its own data
      model. Joining these different networks without new data extraction, transform,
      and load (ETL) processes can reduce the time and expense needed to participate.
      The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) project supports
      data network interoperability through an ontology-driven approach. We use i2b2 as
      a hub, to rapidly reconfigure data to meet new analytical requirements without
      new ETL programming. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our 12-site National Patient-Centered
      Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) uses
      i2b2 to query data. We developed a process to generate a PCORnet Common Data
      Model (CDM) physical database directly from existing i2b2 systems, thereby
      supporting PCORnet analytic queries without new ETL programming. This involved: a
      formalized process for representing i2b2 information models (the specification of
      data types and formats); an information model that represents CDM Version 1.0;
      and a program that generates CDM tables, driven by this information model. This
      approach is generalizable to any logical information model. RESULTS: Eight
      PCORnet CDRN sites have implemented this approach and generated a CDM database
      without a new ETL process from the EHR. This enables federated querying within
      the CDRN and compatibility with the national PCORnet Distributed Research
      Network. DISCUSSION: We have established a way to adapt i2b2 to new information
      models without requiring changes to the underlying data. Eight Scalable
      Collaborative Infrastructure for a Learning Health System sites vetted this
      methodology, resulting in a network that, at present, supports research on 10
      million patients' data. CONCLUSION: New analytical requirements can be quickly
      and cost-effectively supported by i2b2 without creating new data extraction
      processes from the EHR.},

abstract="High-throughput transcriptomic data generated by microarray experiments is the most abundant and frequently stored kind of data currently used in translational medicine studies. Although microarray 
data is supported in data warehouses such as tranSMART, when querying relational databases for hundreds of different patient gene expression records queries are slow due to poor performance. Non-relational da
ta models, such as the key-value model implemented in NoSQL databases, hold promise to be more performant solutions. Our motivation is to improve the performance of the tranSMART data warehouse with a view to
 supporting Next Generation Sequencing data.",
